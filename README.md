Izborna platforma

The platform is using the data from the API: datacentar.io

Since the loading is taking time the data for every year are saved on json files.

We have 2 types of datas:
- Parliamentary and Presidential

And the json files are saved to corresponding directories.

/static/data/parlamentarni

/static/data/presidential

The data and the years that are displayed on the homepage are also saved on the json file, these data are saved in the 

landingpage.json

The data and maps on the homepage are using the file:
map_landing_page.json

Datatable is translated in serbian, and the label texts that are translated are saved in the: 

static/data/datatable_translate.json

The geojson that is used the to draw the map is in the:

static/serbia-municipality.geojson
